<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>TEAMNAME, the official Robotics Team of ACCEL Middle College, is a student-led organization that enables students to explore STEM pathways through hands-on mechanical and software design and development. We learn and practice engineering principles and techniques over the course of designing, building, and programming our competition-ready robot. Founded on principles of dedication, innovation, and collaboration, our team is open to all students of ACCEL Middle College (and some East Side Union High School District students), regardless of prior experience.</p>

<h1>AMC Robotics</h1>
<p>ACCEL Middle College Robotics is a VEX Robotics Team founded in 2020. TEAMNAME, also known as VEX Team 47731M, are a dedicated group of students passionate about technology and design. We are supported by a community of students committed to the success of our fledgling team as we begin our VEX journey.</p>

<h1>ACCEL Middle College</h1>
<p>Accel Middle College Program is a cooperative program between East Side Union High School District and Evergreen Valley Community College, and the home of the TEAMNAME. As a student-run club, our team embraces ACCEL Middle College’s mission to provide students who are capable of challenging themselves in a college environment with equal access to quality education and opportunity in a supportive, encouraging environment. To learn more about ACCEL Middle College, check out our Information page!</p>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<p>We are embarking our VEX journey by participating in two online competitions – Dell Website Challenge and Texas Instruments Electronics Challenge. Given the current situation with the COVID-19 Pandemic, we are unable to meet and build a robot this season. These online challenges have given us an opportunity to still collaborate as a team with different challenges suited to be done online. To learn more about how we work online and see some of our work, please check out our Information page!</p>

<h1>Dell Website Challenge</h1>
<p>As a part of this challenge, we are supposed to develop a website that promotes our robotics program and include important information about what we do, such as programs we participate in, outreach activities, our accomplishments, and much more. Click the button below to learn more about the Dell Website Challenge!</p>

<h1>Texas Instruments Electronics Challenge</h1>
<p>As a part of this challenge, we are supposed to take an electronic device and carefully deconstruct it to find out what components are in the device and research about how each component works and how it is extremely important for the entire system of the device.
